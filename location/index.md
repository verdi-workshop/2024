FACS 2022 presentations and discussion were held online on Zoom.

Feedback and discussion from the audience made use of Zoom's chat
functionality.  Audience members who submitted a question were unmuted for
follow-up questions.

Online coffee breaks were held on wonder.me,
where it is possible to form ad-hoc groups to talk one-on-one or in small
groups.
