Time-triggered architectures (TTAs) were a key
enabler for time-predictable software execution and, thus, for
cyber-physical and embedded systems with real-time requirements.
Controlling software-execution by the means of timer-controlled
interrupts and a predetermined schedule, TTAs are a common
standard to ensure timing in safety-critical systems. Now, with
the emerge of the openly available RISC-V architectures and
the use of its instruction-set extension allows to easily provide
softcore-processors with an application-specific instruction-set
configuration. To support the realtime-capability of such RISC-V
based, application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs), the
presented approach provides timing-instructions as a RISC-V
instruction-set extension to measure and control the software
execution-time at the hardware-level.
