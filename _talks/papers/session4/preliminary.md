Malicious attacks endanger cyber-physical systems to a drastically increasing extent. Successful attacks intruding on the physical part of the system can cause severe or even catastrophic losses. The paper presents a model-based system engineering (MBSE) solution for the assessment and mitigation strategy design tool tailored to the peculiarities of SMEs with limited human and financial resources. The proper quality of the security assessment is assured by using embedded formal methods.
