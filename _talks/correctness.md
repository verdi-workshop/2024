Correctness-by-Construction (CbC) is an incremental software development technique to create functionally correct programs guided by a specification. In contrast to post-hoc verification,
where the specification and verification mainly take part after implementing a program, with CbC the specification is defined first, and then the program is
successively created using a small set of refinement rules. This specification-first approach has the advantage that errors
are likely to be detected earlier in the design process and can be tracked
more easily. Even though the idea of CbC emerged many years ago, CbC
is not widespread and is mostly used to create small algorithms. We believe
in the idea of CbC and envision a scaled CbC approach that contributes to
solving problems of modern software development. In this keynote, I will
give an overview of our work on CbC in four different lines of
research. For all of them, we provide tool support building the CorC
ecosystem that even further enables CbC-based development for different
fields of application and sizes of software systems.
