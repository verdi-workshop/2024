<p>Feature models are a common technique for modeling software variability and representing the possible configurations of a system. This paper presents the llhsc tool, a tool that enables the generation of valid  Devicetree specifications for custom hardware based on the constraints specified in a feature model.</p>

<p>The form of these constraints is a set of logical formulas, which enables product line model validation by means of off-the-shelf satisfiability solvers. In this context, a new set of constraints is defined that specifies both syntax and semantic correctness of a delta-oriented software product line for Devicetree bindings.</p>

<p>This approach provides a more general and flexible solution for static-partitioning hypervisors configuration, but can also be used in systems without virtualization support, enabling the tool to be used in various contexts without sacrificing its generality.</p>

<p>The authors showcase the effectiveness of their approach by means of an empirical running example, which provides evidence supporting the construction of customized configurations for systems that run static-partitioning hypervisors.</p>
