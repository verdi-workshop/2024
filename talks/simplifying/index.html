<p>Developing critical software requires adherence to rigorous software development practices, such as formal requirement specification and verification. Despite their importance, such practices are often considered as complex and challenging tasks that require a strong formal methods background. In this paper, we present our work on simplifying the formal requirements specification experience for resource-constrained mission critical software through the use of structured natural language. To this end, we connect NASAâ€™s FRET, a formal requirement elicitation and authoring tool with the Shelley model checking framework for MicroPython code. We report our experience on using these tools to specify requirements and analyze code from the NASA Ames PHALANX exploration concept.</p>
