<p>The rapid increase in complexity of systems, especially due to the integration of - increasingly automated - subsystems from different domains into cyber-physical systems, presents unique challenges for efficient verification and validation (V&amp;V) processes to meet all requirements and system properties. To address these challenges and enhance quality assurance processes, it is essential to document and analyze V&amp;V workflows. This paper proposes VVML, a novel approach for easy modeling V&amp;V activities in different industrial domains with varying constraints, V&amp;V methods, and tool chains. This approach includes a dedicated modeling notation and a supporting modelling tool. It includes a dedicated modelling notation and tool support, enabling the creation of reusable workflows. The solution enables the creation of reusable workflow assets, such as V&amp;V activities and artifacts, which can be shared across workflows. The VVML approach has been applied to 10+ industrial use cases. This paper explains the basic principles behind VVML and shows an example of its application to an industrial use case.</p>
